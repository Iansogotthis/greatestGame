This is my README


build and render a checkerboard using html css
peice total for each player
piece count for each player
lose/win condition based on either pieceCount === 0
pieces rendered as js objects
loop through board in the beginning and place different peices 
in the proper starting locations based on location of table cells
if else statements connected to a couple of event listeners on  for clicking a peice to select it for movement



table cells with event listeners atttached to allow movement of the piece to the new cell or determine if a peice was "grabbed" during any point or any other changes in the board
